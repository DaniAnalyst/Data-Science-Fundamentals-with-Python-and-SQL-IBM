# Data-Science-Fundamentals-with-Python-and-SQL-IBM

I’m currently taking the IBM Data Science Specialization, which is helping me build a strong foundation in data analysis and key data science tools. Through five online courses, I’m learning essential skills in Python, SQL, statistical analysis, and relational databases, using real-world datasets and open-source libraries.

As part of the applied learning projects, I’m working on tasks such as extracting and visualizing financial data with Pandas, analyzing housing trends through statistical tests and data visualization, and using SQL to explore census, crime, and demographic data to identify factors that influence education, safety, and health indicators.

This specialization is giving me valuable hands-on experience and preparing me to work on more advanced data science projects in the future.
